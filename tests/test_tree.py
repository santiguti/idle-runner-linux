class FakeTree:
    """The ascension panel and its tree tab as measured on 2026-10-26, in AutoIt coordinates.

    A node click opens a modal: green Buy (468, 571) for a node whose prerequisites are met, red with the
    wide "Can't buy yet" text (white at 580, 582) for a locked one, red with "Close" for a bought one.
    Buy unlocks the node and closes the modal. For nodes in `poor` (not enough SP) it opens the offer to pay
    the difference with jewels instead (live, 2026-10-26): an unticked "I understand" box (white at 583, 521),
    the jewel button (094309 at 468, 571) and Close (758, 582). The modal dims the panel (its X tab at
    538, 681 turns 150202), and the dimming fades out for FADE_MS after the modal closes: clicks meanwhile
    are lost (live, 2026-10-26: the check after Village Key's Buy, 222 ms later).

    Hovering a node shows its tooltip: a 262626 box from x + 43, centred on the pointer, with "Cost: N" in
    11AA23 when the SP is enough and AD1111 when it isn't, next to the SP icon (6A31CA); a bought node's
    says "Unlocked", also 11AA23 (measured 2026-10-25). `tooltips=False` hides them; `lying_tooltips`
    shows green for every node. `press_ms` > 0: a purchase that goes through first shows the pressed Buy
    button for that long, in the jewel button's colour (live, 18:47 and 20:04 on 2026-10-26; its box
    stays dark).
