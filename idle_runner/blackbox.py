"""Black box: records the game window all the time and keeps the last minutes of it, so a problem can be
looked at afterwards without reproducing it. Not in the original.

It runs as its own process (`python -m idle_runner blackbox`, started by `run`), so grabbing and
compressing frames (22-27 ms each, measured 2026-10-22) never delays the bot's key timings.
Frames go to log_dir/blackbox/; frames worth keeping are hard-linked into log_dir/marks/<time>-<why>/:
around every anomaly the bot logs, and when the user runs `mark`.
