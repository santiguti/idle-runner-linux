"""Buy Ascension Tree nodes in the user's order. Not in the original (user's request, 2026-10-26).

Measured 2026-10-26: the tree keeps its last pan and zoom, but at
its minimum zoom every node is always at the same place, so the routine zooms all the way out first.
Clicking a node ("Buy on Click" off) opens a modal whose pixel at (468, 571) tells its state: green = Buy
(the prerequisites are met, not necessarily the SP), red = one wide button, "Can't buy yet" (a
prerequisite is missing) or "Close" (bought); the wider text tells them apart, in English and Spanish.

The order is `Settings.tree_order` (by default the wiki's, see tree_nodes.py), which doesn't follow the
tree's links: a node whose prerequisite comes later is skipped until a purchase may have unlocked it. A
node that can be bought but costs more SP than there is stops the routine, so SP is saved in that order.

**Buy without enough SP offers to pay the difference with jewels**, bought with real money (2026-10-26).
So Buy is clicked only after the node's tooltip showed its cost in green (enough SP), and that offer is
closed at once if it shows anyway. Its jewel button needs its "I understand" box ticked first; nothing in
the bot clicks that box.

The nodes seen bought are remembered in state.json between starts (2026-10-28: a Start walked the whole
order again, 23 s). Every run first opens the last one remembered, read-only: an Ultra Ascension resets the
tree, and then that node shows Buy again and the memory is dropped.
