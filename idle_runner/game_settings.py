"""Check the in-game settings the bot needs, at the first Start of each day (the runner keeps the date). Not
in the original, which only listed them.

The settings are a dialog behind the shop's "⋮" tab (measured 2026-10-28): a list that always opens at its top
and scrolls 50 px per wheel notch. A toggle shows a red cross (F83308) on its left when off and a green tick
(1DD700) on its right when on. Each row is told by its label's white pixels, in English or Spanish (the game's
other languages give "not found", never a wrong reading). The bot only reads the list: it ends with "Delete Save" and "Delete Idle Slayer Account" and holds
"Remove Ads" purchases, so the only click inside the dialog is Cancel, and the wheel turns in the empty strip
beside the scrollbar.
